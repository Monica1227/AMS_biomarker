## 1. Introduction
This repository contains source code for paper “Proteomic and clinical biomarkers of acute mountain sickness diagnosis, prognosis, protection, and pathogenesis in a longitudinal cohort”

In this paper, we systematically characterized acute mountain sickness using the plasma proteome and clinical indexes. The proteomic analysis was performde by Olink's PEA techonology and MRM techonology. Ten-paired palsma sample were measured using PEA and performed volcano, PCA, GO & KEGG enrichment and heatmap analysis. Based on the DEPs(q-value < 0.05) identified by PEA and KEGG enrichment, we further validated in an expanded number of proteins, sample size and groups. DIfferential abundace analysis and XGBoost prediction were performed on the MRM identified proteins and clinical indexes between AMS1k and nAMS1k, AMS4k and nAMS4k, AMS4k and AMS1k, nAMS4k and nAMS1k. Finally, correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between AMS phenotypes, proteins and clinical indexes.
